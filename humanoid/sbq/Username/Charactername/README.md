### humanoid

here in this folder, you'll find the template for creating a species for your character, this is something you should only do if you're creating unique graphics for your character, which is probably what you're doing anyway! if your character just uses the same sprites as the vanilla species, only having different clothes, you can probably delete this folder

A new species/character needs at minimum needs these files, youc an look up a tutorial on making a new species to explain these more, I feel they're all self explanitory enough
