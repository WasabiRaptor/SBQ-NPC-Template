# What to do here

This is a house for your NPC to generate in the village on Auri's planet, it is optional, if you don't want this, you can just delete this folder.

You must have edited the `hub.npctype` to have a safe version of the NPC for the shop map, and if you are having a house generate, please delete the `sbqHubRandomNpcList.config.patch` as your NPC will not need to be in that pool if they are having a house generate in the village, this will also prevent SB from CRASHING in the event your NPC spawns from a random NPC selector and your house also attempts to generate and spawn its npc.

You can follow an existing guide on how to use Tiled to edit starbound dungeons, and edit the house here into your own. I would suggest not changing the width to be wider, just leave it at 64, to respect the available space on the map and not overwrite adjacent houses, however, feel free to make the dungeon taller, or go deeper into the ground, but I would suggest not going too deep.

This house *should* be an example of what sort of items to use to summon your NPC as a tenant, though this is not necessary.
