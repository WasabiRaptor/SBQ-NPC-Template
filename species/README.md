# Important!
You only need to make a new species if your NPC is a unique species, or you don't want them reliant on the species they're based on being installed!

If your NPC is just a member of an existing species, and you don't mind them requiring that species to be installed you can just delete this folder, NPCs can use custom assets, such as bodies or hairstyles or clothes that aren't selectable in the customizer even without defining a custom species for them, and you can go ahead and delete this folder rather than fiddling with it


# What To Do here

If you are adding a species for you NPC, there isn't much you need to do with the species file, but there are a few things you probably want to edit within the file to make them more specific to your OC, which I shall note in comments within it

Notable things that you probably would want changed are:
- ouchNoises
- bodyColor
- undyColor
- hairColor
- hair

If you wanted to add more or use the game's vanilla species system to its fullest, you should probably check another guide on adding a species, or check the ingame files on how others are added if they're doing something different that you also want to do.

Again this is a step that isn't necessary for adding an NPC to the mod, so I'm not going to go in more depth, as there are other guides for adding species that could be more helpful, I'm mainly just going to focus on whats needed for the vore aspects
