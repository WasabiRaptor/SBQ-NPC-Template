# What to do here

This NPC should be a variant of your OC that can spawn in the hub map, therefore it should have NSFW settings disabled.

All you have to do is make sure the filename and the npc type names and species in the files are correct.

If you don't want your NPC to spawn in the map, you don't have to bother with this, and can delete this folder.
